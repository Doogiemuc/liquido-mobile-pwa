# Liquido Mobile

Designed for small groups, e.g. social societeies, SMEs, pupils (suggest age >10), open source communities
Liquido Mobile has a uch simpler concept than the larger web based www.Liquido.vote

## Use Case Flow

 0. Open www.liquido.me -> First user automatically becomes Admin
 1. Create a new poll
 2. Invite users (e.g. pupils, members, people who are allowed to vote) by sharing a link.
 3. Every user can add one(!) proposal to that poll
 4. Admin, eg. the teacher, starts the voting phase
 5. User's cast their vote
 6. Admin closes the voting phase
 7. Everyone can see the results.
